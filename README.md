<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of DynamicTekScan is to provide tools to calibrate the output of the tekscan recordings expressed as I-Scan ASCII outputs made during dynamic gait cycles from a KneeSim simulator.

To do this, the simulator output file is required as a .txt tab delimited format. The I-Scan output file is required as a .csv comma separated format.

The variables can be setup as described below. Relative filepaths and string pattern matches can be used to direct the code to the files as demonstrated in the code below.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DynamicTekScan like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(DynamicTekScan)
## basic example code
```
